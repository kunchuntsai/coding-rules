# Rule 58: Keep types and functions in separate namespaces unless they're specifically intended to work together

## Explanation
Don't mix unrelated types and functions in the same namespace. Group related functionality together, but separate independent concerns. This prevents unnecessary coupling and namespace pollution.

## Pros
- **Reduced Coupling**: Independent components don't interfere with each other
- **Clearer Dependencies**: Easy to see what depends on what
- **Reduced Name Conflicts**: Less chance of naming collisions
- **Better Modularity**: Easier to refactor and reorganize code

## Cons
- **More Namespaces**: Can lead to deeper namespace hierarchies
- **More Verbose**: May need more namespace qualifications
- **Initial Overhead**: Requires more thought in design phase

## Examples
